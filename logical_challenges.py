    Ahoy, brave captains! Prepare for battle on the high seas!  
    Here are the rules for this maritime challenge:  

    - The Objective:  
      Sink your opponentâ€™s boats before they sink yours!  

    - The Setup:  
      Each player has a 3x3 grid to command.  
      You must secretly place 2 boats on your grid.  
      Boats can occupy any square, but no two boats can share the same spot.  """)
