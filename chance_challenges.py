        Listen closely, brave adventurer,
        Here are the rules for this peculiar venture.
        Under one of three shells, a key lies concealed:
        Under A, under B, or under C, its hiding spot is revealed.

        - First rule: You have two attempts, no more, no less,
          To uncover the hiding place of the key, I confess.
          After each try, the key‚Äôs position will change,
          It moves in secret, sly and strange.

        - Second rule: Choose wisely, with focus and care,
          Point to a shell and say your prayer.
          If you find the key, victory is yours,
          But fail, and you must try once more.

        - Third rule: Remember, dear contender,
          The odds are tricky, but don‚Äôt surrender.
          Under A, under B, or under C, it could be,
          With sharp wits and luck, you‚Äôll claim the key!

        So, play the game and keep your nerve,
        For here at Fort Boyard, only the bold deserve!
